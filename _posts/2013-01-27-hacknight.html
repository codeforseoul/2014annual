      <h3>Hack Night!</h3>
      <p>'밤에 모여 도시를 해킹하자!'라는 뜻으로 코드포서울 커뮤니티는 매주 월요일 저녁 모임을 갖습니다. 퇴근하고 모인 이 자리에서는 새로운 프로젝트에 대한 아이디어가 오가고, 진행하고 있는 프로젝트 참여자들간의 회의가 진행되고, 한쪽에서는 열심히 소스코드를 작성하는 개발자의 키보드소리가 들립니다.</p>

          <p>We’ve seen a dramatic pick up of our model across the country
          and around the world. The White House borrowed both Code for America's model and founder &mdash; establishing
          the Presidential Innovation Fellowship
          and appointing Jennifer Pahlka as the U.S. Deputy CTO for Government Innovation. Our international partners
          launched Fellowships and Brigades,
          and the City of San Francisco now has both Mayor’s Innovation Fellows and Entrepreneurs-in-Residence.
          In 2013,
          our work led to the creation of 13 new innovation positions in city halls.</p>

          <p>Code for America helps governments understand and build modern
          skill sets through trainings, resources, and one-on-one support.
          Our Peer Network hosts monthly webinars on topics ranging from data-driven policy making to GitHub
          for government. Our fellows work hand-in-hand with their local partners to assess needs and fill gaps. And by
          showcasing what’s
          working in individual cities, we’re helping to establish new standards for civic innovation.</P>

          Government data is only useful when it's made available to the public and integrated with the websites
          people use everyday. In 2013, Code for America worked to make this standard practice. We walked cities
          through the process of passing an open data policy,
          deploying a data portal, and releasing data in standardized formats. Chicago’s former Chief Data Officer, Brett Goldstein, and Code for America's Lauren Dyson
          co-edited Beyond Transparency, an anthology of public data experts. In total, we inspired the creation
          of 30 new local government policies to support innovation and established three new civic data
          specifications.</p>
