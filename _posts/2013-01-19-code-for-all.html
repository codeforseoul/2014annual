          <h3>코드포올(CODE FOR ALL)</h3>
          <p class="blurb">In response to massive interest from around the world,
          we launched Code for All to help organizations everywhere bring the Code for America model and
        mission to their countries. For 2013 we selected six pilot partners.
          </p>
          <p class="blurb">By uniting this network of civic change agents and providing them with actionable resources, we are supporting a global movement for more
          innovative and open government. As the network continues to grow, we know that we'll learn as much from these partners as they will from us.</p>

It’s trying to understand their experience, and then seeing where is it that you can leverage technology in that space to create positive impact.”</p>
