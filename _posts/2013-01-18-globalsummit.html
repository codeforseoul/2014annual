          <p>We’ve seen a dramatic pick up of our model across the country
          and around the world. The White House borrowed both Code for America's model and founder &mdash; establishing
          the Presidential Innovation Fellowship
          and appointing Jennifer Pahlka as the U.S. Deputy CTO for Government Innovation. Our international partners
          launched Fellowships and Brigades,
          and the City of San Francisco now has both Mayor’s Innovation Fellows and Entrepreneurs-in-Residence.
          In 2013,
          our work led to the creation of 13 new innovation positions in city halls.</p>

          <p>Code for America helps governments understand and build modern
          skill sets through trainings, resources, and one-on-one support.
          Our Peer Network hosts monthly webinars on topics ranging from data-driven policy making to GitHub
          for government. Our fellows work hand-in-hand with their local partners to assess needs and fill gaps. And by
          showcasing what’s
          working in individual cities, we’re helping to establish new standards for civic innovation.</P>
