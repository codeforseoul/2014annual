          <h3>BRIGADE</h3>
            <p>The Brigade is a network of volunteers who are using their
            talents to better their communities. In 2013 the Brigade doubled in size, with nearly
            3,000 members and 31 U.S. chapters, and expanded to include international partners.
            Brigades are maintaining and redeploying apps, advocating for their government to make
            its data public and pass data policies, and building technology. Each Brigade works
            hand-in-hand with the local government and holds regular events.</p>

        <p>"The Brigade program is building the much needed person-to-person
        network that fuels the internet's motto of 'small pieces loosely joined.' The world's
        civic hackers are linking arm-in-arm to share stories, best practices, and code.
        These bonds are invaluable as we work to improve local public services &mdash; and improve
        quality of life for all.”</p>

        at complex civic issues &mdash; including transparency, crime, housing, permitting, and delivery of social
        services &mdash; they are fundamentally redefining government by continually asking, 'What’s next?'"</p>
